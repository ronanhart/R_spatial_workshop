# Spatial Data in R

## Vectors 

The primary packages that deal with these features are [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) and [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html)

**sf** means "simple feature" while **sp** is short for "spatial." There are pros and cons to both (for example, a lot of other packages depend on `sp`, `sf` works well in `tidyverse`, etc.). However, in my opinion, there is no reason that you can't use both in the same code, if needed. We will go over these packages in the next chapter.

## Rasters 

The primary packages that deal with rasters are [`raster`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html) and [`terra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html)
